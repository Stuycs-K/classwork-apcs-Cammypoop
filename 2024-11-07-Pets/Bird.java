  //7:Override the getName() method so that a bid's name is "The Mighty NAME" instead of "NAME"
  //e.g. "The Mighty Polly" instead of just "Polly"
  //You can call the superclass' getName method using the syntax: super.getName()
  public String getName(){
    return "The Mighty " + super.getName();
  }
  //Step 8:In Driver.java answer: What is the difference before and after you override this method?
  //What does this tell us about methods that are overridden?
  //public String getName(){  }

  //Go back and complete steps 9 onwards.
